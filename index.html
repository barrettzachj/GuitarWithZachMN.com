						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>With 12+ years of teaching experience and over 10,000 lessons taught, I've had students from age 5 to 75, teaching everything from rock to classical to improv and songwriting. All musical and personal backgrounds are welcome!</p>
						
						<h3>To parents looking to enroll their kids:</h3>
						<p>Together we can help your kids discover their creativity and grow through music while building the foundational skill and knowledge that it takes to be a musician. My number one priority is making guitar lessons a positive experience. I strive to foster my student's love for music and build their confidence along the way.</p>
