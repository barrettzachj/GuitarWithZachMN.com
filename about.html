						<p>Hi there, I'm Zach! My musical journey started at a young age when I learned piano from my grandma who was a classical pianist and organist. On my 12th birthday, I got my first guitar and started learning rock music. In high school, I played in jazz band and began to experiment with improvisation and songwriting. In college, I studied music production at Indiana University while playing in the Clayton Anderson Band and Porch Pickin. I became obsessed with The Beatles thanks to a 'History of The Beatles' course (shoutout professor Glen Gass!) Since then, it's rare that you will see me perform and not hear a Beatles cover.</p>
						
						<p>Recently, I've performed with a variety of groups in the Twin Cities area. I've done everything from wedding ceremonies to cover bands to original music. My band Fast Gladys is currently in the process of recording their first album. You can find some of my guitar noodlings on Instagram @booboobarrett.</p>
						
						<p>My teaching style is very adaptable to meet a student's goals. For kids, I focus on creating a fun and positive environment, helping them to discover their creativity and grow through music. For adults, I'm here to help you accomplish whatever musical goals you have, no matter how big or small. Many of my adult students have enjoyed my "shortcut theory" method for students who want to understand music better, improvise, and write songs without having to spend years learning notation and other traditional "prerequisites".</p>
